#### Blog posting for next week
<small>March 13 2020</small>

Thank you for today’s session – it was probably a challenge for all of us. But hopefully a rewarding one.

You blog posting for next week should be about research paradigms; please don’t try to recount everything that was said today, but try instead to give the posting your own personal touch and relate it to the work/courses you are currently doing – or have done. In other words make the posting relevant to yourself. Then there is a good chance that it might also be interesting for me and others to read.

Looking forward 🙂

#### Ontologies, Epistemologies into Paradigms; a small guide to my presentation today
<small>March 13 2020</small>

**Ontological continuum**

Ontologyrefers to our assumptions of what exists, or what is ‘real’.  It can range from **nominalism** (things are only what we as an individual think exists) to **realism** (believing that everything exists in an objective way and we can all experience it objectively).

Other positions include **‘constructivism’** – reality is socially constructed – some things only have an existence because we, as people, as a society or as a culture, agree that they do.

**Epistemological continuum**

**Epistemology**
refers to the type of valid knowledge that we can obtain about things.  This can be characterised in various ways for example from **positivism** (regularity, measurement, objective observation, causal effects) to **anti-positivism** (each person’s perception is valid).

One important view is that of those who believe in **interpretivism** – who believe that the researcher can never be objective and that human interpretation and understanding is also ‘valid’ knowledge.

**Research paradigms**
Where different ontologies overlap with different epistemological approaches,  we have ‘paradigms’ (or ways of undertaking the search for valid knowledge). For example, Western thought has for many centuries been characterized by the acceptance of the **‘classicscientific paradigm’** – a realist ontology with a positivist epistemology.

However, the **post-modernist movement** of the last half of the 20th century may be moving us towards a different paradigm as the epistemological position moves more towards an interpretivist or even anti-positivist (relativism) approach. Ontology **nominalism** (things are only what we as an individual think exists)

The **social science** paradigm falls somewhat in the middle and is often characterised by a ‘constructionist’ ontology and an interpretivist epistemology.  

Visual artists (i.e. painters) are much further toward the other ends of both continuums

#### Have I misunderstood what a scientific paradigm is?
<small>March 13 2020</small>

In the past concerned students have contacted me because they actually looked up what a Scientific Paradigm is – and the explanation is not at all like the one I gave.

Don’t worry – there are many ways of explaining what it is – my one might be a bit unusual. Try to choose one though, and see how much you can get out of it. The main ones I talked about were:

* Classic Scientific Paradigm
* Social Science Paradigm
* Post-Modernist Approach

And then I mentioned one single method that possibly could bypass a definite choice; Design Science. But there are many other paradigms and methods – and ways to escape a definite choice. Confused?

You should be 🙂

But from now on we are making things simpler – hopefully 🙂

#### Questions about truth and facts
<small>March 6 2020</small>

1. Is there adifference between ‘knowing’ something and ‘having knowledge’ of something?
2. What is ‘truth’?
3. What do we really mean when we say something is ‘true’?
4. Is there a difference between knowing something is ‘true’ and believing that something is ‘true’?
5. What is the difference between subjective and objective ‘truth’?
6. What is a ‘fact’ and can ‘facts’ change ?
7. How do we discover if something is ‘true’ or not?
8. “We do not see things as they are but as we are” Anais Nin. What does this mean?
9. “Reality is an illusion, albeit a very persistent one” (Einstein) What does this mean?
10. Is there a difference between ‘true’ and ‘valid’? Explain!

#### Blog posting for next week
<small>March 6 2020</small>

1. What is ontology? How is it relevant to research? 
2. What is epistemology? How is it relevant to research?
3. What is the connection between ontology and epistemology in a research context?

Next week we will discuss the Scientific Paradigms – and get started with thinking about the first assignment.

#### First blog posting
<small>February 28 2020</small>

Follow the instructions in for exmple WordPress.com to set up the blog. If you are using an existing blog, please create a RES701 category.

Email me the url; Lars.Dam@nmit.ac.nz

Write your first post:

* What do you think ‘research’ is?
* Do you think you will ever need research skills?
* What do you think a research journal is and who is it written for?
* What is plagiarism?
* Why is it important to avoid it?

#### Why blogging in RES701?
<small>February 28 2020</small>

As you might have sensed by now, it is very important for this course, that we create and maintain a ‘research community’. One of the most important and efficient ways of doing this, is to write up your reflections on the discussions and the presentations in the classroom and what you are learning, as we move along.

This means staying up to date with this blog and update you own blog weekly – at least. So bookmark this blog and follow it.

As soon as possible, we will have links up to all of your blogs here. You will then be able to follow the learning journey of your classmates – selectively if you like 🙂

Don’t take the competition with your classmates to seriously. Some are very good at writing and if they are very competitive, they would have something impressive up most of the time. What I am looking for from everyone, is active participation and deep thinking. Which does require some writing at the end of the day. So – do your best – consistently 🙂 – as in any other teamwork.

#### The old RES701 blog 
<small>February 2020</small>

This is the new RES701 Class Blog Space, built for ongoing communications during the course.
Moodle will act as the static course place holder for assignments, drop-boxes, etc.
There might also be some interesting and/or relevant information on the [Old RES701 blog](https://nmitresearchmethods.wordpress.com/).
